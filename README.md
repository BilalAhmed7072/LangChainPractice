# ü¶ú LangChainPractice

Welcome to **LangChainPractice** ‚Äî a beginner-friendly repository designed to help learners (like me!) understand and build AI applications using **LangChain**.

This repo includes hands-on notebooks, code snippets, and explanations that make it easier for beginners to start using **LangChain** with OpenAI, Hugging Face, and local models.

## üöÄ What is LangChain?

**LangChain** is a powerful open-source framework that helps developers build applications powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.  
It connects LLMs with:
- External data sources (databases, APIs, documents)
- Tools (retrievers, vector stores, agents)
- Memory and reasoning logic

LangChain allows you to move **from simple prompts to intelligent AI systems**.

## üß© Key Concepts to Learn

### 1. **Prompts**
Learn how to design and structure prompts to get the best responses from LLMs.
- System prompts
- User prompts
- Few-shot examples
- Templates and variables

### 2. **LLMs**
Use different LLMs from:
- **OpenAI (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)**
- **Hugging Face Transformers**
- **Local models**

### 3. **Chains**
Chains link multiple components together ‚Äî for example, passing input ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí output through a sequence of logical steps.

### 4. **Agents**
Agents can **decide** what actions to take based on user input.  
Example: an AI assistant that decides whether to search the web, fetch data, or answer directly.

### 5. **Memory**
Memory allows your AI app to **remember** past interactions (like a chat history).

### 6. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**
RAG combines LLMs with your **own data** (PDFs, databases, etc.) using **vector embeddings** and **retrievers** (like FAISS, Pinecone, Chroma).
